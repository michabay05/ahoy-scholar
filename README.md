## "Elevator Pitch"
As seniors in high school, the entire college process is tedious, time-consuming. As we go through this process, we are often bombarded with way too many information, especially when searching for scholarships. That is where **ahoy-scholar** comes into play. The primary objective of this project is to help seniors prioritize their scholarship applications based on which scholarship they are more likely to win (or in other words, be worth their time). By factoring in the scholarship source, essay word count, and scholarship value, a scholarship niche score is provided where a higher score implies a worthwhile scholarship.
